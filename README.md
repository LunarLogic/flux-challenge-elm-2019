# flux-challenge-elm

A solution to [flux-challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) written in Elm.

## Starting the app

1. Start the frontend server by running `yarn run start` (install packages by running `yarn` first).
2. In a separate shell, start the backend server by changing the directory to `server` and also running
`yarn run start` (you may need to install the deps first with `yarn` too).
